    "A diamond merchant finds that her employees are quite inconsistent when pricing the diamonds they buy and sell. Perhaps if there were a pricing tool that they could consult - to get a guideline price - then there would be greater consistency across her employees. She asks you to build the tool. Most important to her is correct pricing - but if the tool can explain its prices, so much the better.\n",

    "Each row in the CSV file contains 10 pieces of data, which she explains as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Carat: The carat value of a diamond is a measure of its weight. One carat is 200 milligranms.\n",
    "- Cut: The cut type of a diamond (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal) is a measure of quality: how it interacts with light.\n",
    "- Colour: The colour grade of a diamond, in this case from J -> worst to D -> best.\n",
    "- Clarity: The clarity of a diamond in terms of transparency, in this case from I1 -> worst through SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, to IF -> best.\n",
    "- Depth: The depth of a diamond is calculated as (Height * 200) / (Width + Length). It's a percentage and, apparently, 59-62% is ideal.\n",
    "- Table: The table of a diamond refers to the flat facet that you can see when you look at the diamond from above. The value recorded here is the width of this facet times 100 divided by the Width of the diamond. Apparently, 53-58% is ideal.\n",
    "- Price: This is the target value. It is given in US dollars.\n",
    "- Width: Millimetres.\n",
    "- Length: Millimetres.\n",
    "- Height: Millimetres."
